Studying eye movements during multiple readings of the same texts provides a unique opportunity to observe the consistency of saccadic landing positions. Eye movements were recorded while 5 people read the same 4 texts more than 40 times, no more than 4 times/day, and never on consecutive trials. Other texts, read only once, were interspersed. Comprehension questions and a change-detection task helped maintain attention in the face of the repetition. There were two main findings: (1) repeated reading produced significant, but modest, changes in global saccadic patterns",

For example, a physical therapy patient will average eight appointments for reoccurring care, so if an average visit costs $100, your practice could be gaining $800 by converting a potential patient into an actual one. Getting a new patient to actually walk through the door can mean the difference between a long-term relationship or no relationship at all.",
